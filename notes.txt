* A snapshot of data (July 2021) from all of the COPs have been migrated to SharePoint (~ 53,000 data points)
* Data is connected to Power BI, ready for analysis (extension of previous proof-of-concept)
* People and locations on the skills matrices have been correlated using Active Directory data, linked by the Genesis MDM
* The data-input end using Power Apps has implementation details to be worked out - data volume is unprecedented
* The data analysis end of the application is more readily usable - will focus on this to generate short-term benefits
* Timeline projections: 
	* Set up Power BI report with analytics on July dataset by end of first week of September
	* Speak to Commercial COP on benefits and requested features
	* Implement by third requests by third week of September
	* Resume front-end work after this

Challenges:
* Power Apps and data volume
	Loading in this volume of data (>2,000 rows) into Power Apps from SharePoint requires an iterative workaround technique. Using this technique on the currect dataset of ~53,000 rows is possible, but takes ~5mins. This has to happen on app startup, in order to set up the app for functions downstream. This is an experience-breaking limitation that needs to be solved.
	
	* Attempted solution #1: Use an SQL database in place of SharePoint List
		* Status: Web server with SQL database is operational and is giving correct data. 
			Currently working on two fronts:
			* Receiving the data reliably
			* Getting Power Apps to interpret the data correctly
		* If successful, future tasks: 
			* Flesh out web server to handle database write (currently only configured to read)
			* Continue with front-end application development
	
	* Fallback solution
		* Retain Excel spreadsheets as input method
		* Automate collation of data from individual spreadsheets into Power BI
